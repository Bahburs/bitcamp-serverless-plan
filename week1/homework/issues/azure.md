### Azure

So what is "Azure"? Well if you made it into Bit Camp, you really should know already... but according to Microsoft, "*Azure is an ever-expanding set of cloud services to help your organization meet your business challenges. Itâ€™s the freedom to build, manage, and deploy applications on a massive, global network using your favorite tools and frameworks*." If you want to learn more about Azure and all its cloud applications, feel free to checkout this [link](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-azure/), an overview of its capabilities.



To create an Azure account, go to:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/ and press **Start free** to be relocated to a signup page. After signing in with your Microsoft account and filling in your personal details, you will be asked to add a credit card. Rest assure, this is only for security purposes, you won't be charged unless you choose to buy a premium account. If you need some help navigating Azure, checkout this super helpful [resource](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/get-started/) provided by Microsoft.
