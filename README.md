# Bitcamp-Serverless
**Week 4**
Knowing how to work with and call APIs is super important. We're going to practice reading documentation and working with APIs this week by adding a **Find Song** feature to your html webpage!
We will
1. learn the basics of using the module design pattern in Javascript
2. use the Spotify API to find song recommendations
3. display the song recommendations
