# Bitcamp-Serverless
**Week 2**

This week, we're focusing on creating an Azure Function that uses the Microsoft Face API to detect emotion in a face. 
We'll be going over how to:
1. parse multipart form data
2. create a Face API resource
3. make a http request to the face api
4. configure npm dependencies in Functions
