## Downloading an IDE, Configuring Azure, and Learning GitHub

*For this assignment, you will follow the instructions and at the end, complete a task showing your knowledge of the subject. If at any moment you need help, feel free to contact your TAs.*

### Visual Studio Code

Before we start coding, we need to install an IDE. An IDE is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. Although there are hundreds of IDEs to choose from, we are going to use Visual Studio Code due to its popularity and integration with Azure (via extensions and libraries).



To install VSC, go to: https://code.visualstudio.com/download and choose your operating system (ie. Windows, Mac, Linux, etc). Then click **Download** and run the installer (usually a .exe or .zip). After it's installed, open it up and try it out. If you need some help navigating VSC, checkout this super helpful [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqCgcpAypFQ) video.

**Task 1: create a JavaScript file that prints out "Hello World" in the terminal.**

### Azure

So what is "Azure"? Well if you made it into Bit Camp, you really should know already... but according to Microsoft, "*Azure is an ever-expanding set of cloud services to help your organization meet your business challenges. Itâ€™s the freedom to build, manage, and deploy applications on a massive, global network using your favorite tools and frameworks*." If you want to learn more about Azure and all its cloud applications, feel free to checkout this [link](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-azure/), an overview of its capabilities.



To create an Azure account, go to:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/ and press **Start free** to be relocated to a signup page. After signing in with your Microsoft account and filling in your personal details, you will be asked to add a credit card. Rest assure, this is only for security purposes, you won't be charged unless you choose to buy a premium account. If you need some help navigating Azure, checkout this super helpful [resource](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/get-started/) provided by Microsoft.



**Task 2: create and deploy an HTTP trigger Azure Function that outputs the current time and date.**

### GitHub

If you haven't heard of GitHub before, you must have been living under a rock for the past ten years. GitHub is a cloud-based repository hosting service that is widely used in the tech industry. It allows teams to use Git for version control, collaboration, and file management. If you don't know what Git is, it's a version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers. 

If you want to learn more about *what it is* and *how to use it*, try taking [this](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github#:~:text=Audience.%201%20Assign%20yourself.%20Assign%20the%20first%20issue,an%20issue.%20%204%20Create%20a%20branch.%20) GitHub Learning Lab Course. After finishing it, you will have a strong understanding of all the features GitHub has to offer. To make an account, go to: https://github.com/join to sign up. After making an account, you're all set to complete Task 3!



**Task 3: create a temporary repository and commit a readme.md file (make sure you know key functions like commits, forking, pull request, branch, etc).**



Good job, you're done!
