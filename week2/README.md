Last week, you should've learned the basics of how to create an Azure Function, along with the basics of triggers and bindings.

Livestream:
We're going to code a HTTP trigger Azure Function that detects facial hair in a submitted picture and testing the function using Postman. Concepts covered include installing and using npm pacakges, parsing form data, and sending a HTTP request using fetch.

Homework:
The homework this week will be to create a HTTP trigger Azure Function that analyzes the emotions in a submitted picture.
