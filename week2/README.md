# Bitcamp-Serverless
## Week 2
Last week, you should've learned the basics of how to create an Azure Function, along with the basics of triggers and bindings.

### Livestream
In the livestream, we're going to code a HTTP trigger Azure Function that detects facial hair in a submitted picture. 
- For the full video, look in the [video folder](livestream/videos). 
- For the full code, look in the [code folder](livestream/code).

We'll be going over how to:
1. parse multipart form data
2. create a Face API resource
3. make a HTTP request to the Face API
4. configure npm dependencies in Functions
5. test the function using Postman

### Homework
Create a HTTP trigger Azure Function that uses the Face API to analyze emotion in a picture. 
- The step by step runthrough is located in the [issues folder](homework/issues). Follow the issues numerically to complete the project. 
- Any starter and solution code is in the [code folder](homework/code) in homework.
