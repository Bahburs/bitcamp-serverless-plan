Before the actual programming, here's a quick overview of how the project is structured. We're going to be using the **module pattern** in javascript, which kind of mimicks **classes** in OOP languages like Java. Kind of. 

**Basics:**

- allows encapsulation and separation of private/public variables and methods
- better organization and separation of concerns
- implemented with Closures and IIFEs



Let's take a look at an example:

```js
const car = (function(){
  var speed = 100;
  return {
  	forward() {
      speed += 1;
    }
	}
})();
```

The variable speed is available only within the scope of the function, so it can't be accessed from the outside environment. However, it can be changed through the use of a **Closure**. A Closure in Javascript is an inner function that has access to the variables of its outer function. In this case, our outer function is returning the function `forward`,  which allows us to change the value of private variable `speed`  without allowing us direct access.

Also notice that the function declaration is surrounded by parentheses, with another pair at the end of the declaration. This makes the function an IIFE, or **Immediately-invoked Function Expression**. IIFEs are that defined as expressions and executed immediately after creation. The first pair of parentheses, which wrap the function, indicate an expression. In Javascript, expressions evaluate to a single value, which in this case is our actual function. To call the function immediately, we add the second pair of parentheses `();`,  like how you would call an normal function. 



Anything declared in an IIFE is not visible to the global scope, meaning that something like the `forward`  function we returned can only be accessed through the const `car`.  This practice allows us to contain all relevant methods to `car`  within in its own scope and also avoid polluting the global scope with variables that are only being used in one place.

In this project, we're going to have two separate modules that handle distinct concernsâ€“ one called `APIController`for handling API calls and the other called `UIController `for handling our HTML input fields.  A third module, called `APPController`,  will handle the actually retrieving and displaying the data. Each module will have public methods that the `APPController`  will call.

To get started, create a new js file called `Song.js` . I've already declared `APPController`  for you. Finish writing the function expressions for `APIController`  and `UIController`. 

```js
//look at the above example and the APPController declaration for syntax
//both API and UI modules take in no parameters

//spotify api call
const APIController = ??

// UI Module
const UIController = ??

  
const APPController = (function(UICtrl, APICtrl) {

})(UIController, APIController);

```
